# Fish shell  function

Fish shell function to automate my Git commits and merges and pushes and pulls and you get the idea. 

This can be made way more modular, but I needed it real quick. 

You need to be using Fish shell to use this. You really need to be using it anyway, it's awesome. 

Save the file to ~/.config/fish/functions.

I had to create the functions dir. 

Be sure to replace all the dirs and branchnames with your stuff. 

Obviously I am on a Mac with CodeKit and sometimes if it's open when you pull, it recompiles LESS or what have you and things get confusing. So this closes it and then opens it back up at the end. 

### Usage:

gititon "your descriptive commit message here"
