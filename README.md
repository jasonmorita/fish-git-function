# Fish shell  function

Fish shell function to automate my Git commits and merges and pushes and pulls and you get the idea. 

This can be made way more modular, but I needed it real quick. 

You need to be using Fish shell to use this. You really need to be using it anyway, it's awesome. 

Save the file to ~/.config/fish/functions.

I had to create the functions dir. 

Be sure to replace all the dirs and branchnames with your stuff. 

### Usage:

gititon "your descriptive commit message here"
